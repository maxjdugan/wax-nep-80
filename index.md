## __A case study in power, knowledge production, and the itinerary of an Islamic object.__

<br>
<br>

Examine the particulars. Read our narration of the passage of __NEP-80__ (a *juz'*, thirtieth of the Qur'an, manuscript) from __Dimitri Andalaft's__ shop in Khan al-Khalili in Cairo to the Penn Museum in Philadelphia. Learn about the main characters, __George Byron Gordon__ and Dimitri Andalaft in their respective exhibits. Analyze the images and the metadata; find details we overlooked in haste.

If you have any questions or feedback, we'd love to hear it! Just shoot us an [email](mailto:max.j.dugan@gmail.com) and we'll get back to you soon
